        <p>I have previously taken the courses "ITGK" and "TDT4100 Objectoriented programming" at NTNU, so that basically describes my currently coding-skills. 
            I have never been coding in html before, so this is quite new for me. Even though I haven't been coding that much, I find it really interesting, especially when thinking of how we can use it to solve different problems in the real world. </p>
    
        <p> My expectations for this course is to try to enjoy learning to code in a new language, and to learn to as much as possible. I hope that the cooperation with my fellow students works properly, and that we are able to share the workload. </p>
        
        <p> I have also always dreamt of learning how to create a website, so I think that this course could be really interesting, and I am looking forward to dig into the subject.</p>

        <ol>
            <li> The server provides the client with different servides, which depends of the requests from the client. For example the client could send a "http request", and the server would then most likely respond with the requested website.</li>
            <li> The client sends different requests to the server, for example when requesting a webpage. The client is basically what we think of as the user, and could recieve different things from the server through a browser. </li>
            <li> IP address stands for Internet Protocol adress, and is a main component within the core of the internet. We could say that the internet is a network of networks, and in order for these networks to send and recieve information, the routers and switches in the network have to know where to send things,
                and simply said this is why we have the IP address.</li>
            <li> DNS stands for Domain Name Server, and translates a URL to an IP address. This is also a main component of the internet, becasue it would be very unpractical if you would need to remember the IP address for each individual webpage. For example when you type in "nrk.no" in the search-bar the browser translates that to the correct IP address. </li>
            <li> Internet is the network of networks, and refers to this infrastructure, but WWW is "just" one of different applications that uses the internet's infrastructure. For example E-mail uses the internet, but that doesn't necessarily need to involve WWW. </li>
            <li> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is a commonly used programming language for webpages, and the webbrowsers then converts these files into webpages that can be accessed by users (clients). </li>
            <li> We place the CSS in the head, so that the CSS styles are loaded before the browser starts converting the html-file to a webpage. </li>
            <li> Inline style CSS would override rules defined in style elements and external stylesheets because it has a higher specificity. Inline style CSS typically only apply for one or a few elemnents, while external stylesheets could apply for many more. Thus, inline style CSS overrides the external stylesheet. </li>
        </ol>
